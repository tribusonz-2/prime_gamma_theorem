# Prime Gamma Theorem

```
\ln(0!) = 0
\ln(1!) = 0
\ln(2!) = 1 \ln(2)
\ln(3!) = 1 \ln(2) + 1 \ln(3)
\ln(4!) = 3 \ln(2) + 1 \ln(3)
\ln(5!) = 3 \ln(2) + 1 \ln(3) + 1 \ln(5)
\ln(6!) = 4 \ln(2) + 2 \ln(3) + 1 \ln(5)

"Prime numbers have nothing to do with gamma integrals"... Mathematicians may have held such a view.  
However, when we decompose the logarithmic factorial function into prime factors, we find that all the factors are prime numbers.  
It was hidden inside the logarithm.  
I would like to name this the "prime gamma theorem".  
We have discovered about three algorithms so far, the "fourth" algorithm is a really interesting research material because it is Euler's integral.
