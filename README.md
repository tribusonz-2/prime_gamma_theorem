# Prime Gamma Theorem

## Overview

```
\ln(0!) = 0
\ln(1!) = 0
\ln(2!) = 1 \ln(2)
\ln(3!) = 1 \ln(2) + 1 \ln(3)
\ln(4!) = 3 \ln(2) + 1 \ln(3)
\ln(5!) = 3 \ln(2) + 1 \ln(3) + 1 \ln(5)
\ln(6!) = 4 \ln(2) + 2 \ln(3) + 1 \ln(5)

"Prime numbers have nothing to do with gamma integrals"... Mathematicians may have held such a view.  
However, when we decompose the logarithmic factorial function into prime factors, we find that all the factors are prime numbers.  
It was hidden inside the logarithm.  
I would like to name this the "prime gamma theorem".  
We have discovered about three algorithms so far, the "fourth" algorithm is a really interesting research material because it is Euler's integral.  

## Terms that cannot be explained

We obtain an equation  

$$ \ln(p!) = \ln((p-1)!) + \ln(p), p  \in \mathbb{P} $$  

When $p!$ is equal to a prime number, the natural number or prime number obtained by subtracting 1 from $p$ has the term $\ln(p)$ as the difference.  
It seems strange at first glance. Because it's a theorem.  
If someones asking it "1+1 equals 2, right?", they will most likely answer, "Yes". - This isn't such a strange conversation.  
If someones asking it "Adding ln((n-1)!) and ln(n) equals ln(n!), right?", Would the answer be "yes"?  
This equation has no explanation.  
There are many ways to explain that adding 1 and 1 equals 2. So this "equation" can be explained. However, the equation for the prime gamma integral has no explanation. It appears out of nowhere.
